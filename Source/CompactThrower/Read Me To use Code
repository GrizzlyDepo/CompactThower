Sound files i used are here - https://github.com/WRuff2007/ProtonPack/tree/1.0.1-mychanges
New to Git so didnt know how to link over tree.

Here are some of the updates:
Removed the orange hat light and vent lights
I used a 12 LED ring light for the cyclotron which might be screen accurate but I like the connection.  
Updated Code to WRuff did for the ring lights.  

About me:
My name is Steven DiPaola and go by GrizzlyDepo on social media.  I am a member of the Hudson Valley Ghostbusters.  I have built two Q-Packs both electronics are the MikeS11 Code.  I highly recommend the WholesomeJoe videos on how to do the packs wiring!

I am not a programmer but have some background (grew up learning programming languages, college had classes that required programming but those were all over a decade ago).  

Any questions or suggestions feel free to send them my way and I will see what I can do.  This is a hobby and I work full time so I will likely not be able to respond quickly but will do my best.
